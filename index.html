         Now Rann the Kite brings home the night
            That Mang the Bat sets free--
         The herds are shut in byre and hut
            For loosed till dawn are we.
         This is the hour of pride and power,
            Talon and tush and claw.
         Oh, hear the call!--Good hunting all
            That keep the Jungle Law!
         Night-Song in the Jungle

    <img src= "elephants.jpg" atl = "elephants"> It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
    Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
    spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
    in their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her
    four tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the
    cave where they all lived. "Augrh!" said Father Wolf. "It is time to
    hunt again." He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
    a bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: "Good luck go with you, O
    Chief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
    children that they may never forget the hungry in this world."

  <p>
    <img src= "jungle.jpg" alt = "jungle">It was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India
    despise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling
    tales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
    rubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more
    than anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
    that he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
    everything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui
    goes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
    a wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the
    madness--and run.
